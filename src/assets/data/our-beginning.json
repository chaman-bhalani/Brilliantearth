    "description": "In 2004, Co-Founder and CEO Beth Gerstein couldn’t find a diamond engagement ring that was ethical, sustainable, and traceable. She wanted the sparkling symbol of her commitment to represent more than love: the perfect piece would also respect the planet and protect its future. On a mission to make the jewelry industry more sustainable and ethical, Beth — alongside Eric Grossberg — founded Brilliant Earth in 2005.   From that first step through today, we've revolutionized the way jewelry is sourced, crafted, sold, and worn. We do not compromise between quality and conscience — and neither do our customers.",
